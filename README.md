# E-commerce Delivery Analytics and Predictive Modeling

This repository hosts a comprehensive suite of SQL queries and predictive analytics models for an e-commerce delivery dataset. Our goal is to provide actionable insights into customer behavior, order patterns, delivery performance, and revenue trends—and to forecast future outcomes such as delivery delays and refund probabilities.

## Overview
In today’s dynamic e-commerce environment, understanding historical performance is crucial—but so is predicting future trends. This project leverages SQL to perform deep-dive analyses on delivery and order data while also implementing predictive models to forecast:
- **Delivery Delays:** Anticipate orders that might be delayed.
- **Refund Requests:** Estimate the likelihood of refund requests based on order characteristics.
- **Revenue Trends:** Project future revenue based on past performance.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Platform**: E-commerce platform used (e.g., Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, JioMart).
- **Order Date & Time**: Timestamp indicating when the order was placed *(note: time values are provided; a default or external date may be needed)*.
- **Delivery Time (Minutes)**: Time taken to deliver the order.
- **Product Category**: Product category (e.g., Dairy, Grocery, Snacks, Personal Care).
- **Order Value (INR)**: Order revenue in Indian Rupees.
- **Customer Feedback**: Customer comments.
- **Service Rating**: Numeric rating provided by customers.
- **Delivery Delay**: Indicator of whether an order was delayed.
- **Refund Requested**: Indicator if a refund was requested ('Yes' or 'No').

## SQL Queries and Data Analysis
The repository contains SQL scripts that answer questions such as:
- **Customer Insights:**  
  - How many unique customers have placed orders?  
  - Which customers have placed the highest number of orders?  
  - What is the revenue contribution of the top 10 customers?

- **Order Analysis:**  
  - What is the total number of orders placed?    
  - How do delivery time vary by product category?

- **Delivery Performance:**  
  - What is the average delivery time?  
  - Which platform has the fastest deliveries?
  
- **Financial Metrics:**  
  - What are the top-selling product categories by revenue?  
  - How much revenue is lost due to refunds?

## Predictive Analytics

Based on the insights derived from the SQL analyses, here are some advanced recommendations to optimize your e-commerce delivery operations and enhance customer satisfaction:

**Improve Delivery Performance:**

Although the average delivery time is around 29.5 minutes, slight variations across product categories (e.g., slower performance in Grocery or Personal Care) indicate that specific categories might be facing logistical challenges. Consider investigating and optimizing routes, warehouse management, or courier performance in these segments.

**Reduce Refunds and Enhance Service Quality:**

With a refund rate of over 45%, it's critical to analyze the root causes (e.g., delayed deliveries, product quality issues).

**Focus on High-Value Customer Segments:**

The top 10 customers contribute a significant percentage of revenue. Tailor loyalty programs, personalized offers, and exclusive services to retain and further engage these high-value customers.
Further segment your customer base by order frequency, order value, and feedback to identify potential upsell or cross-sell opportunities.

**Leverage Cross-Platform Best Practices:**

With platforms like JioMart showing slightly faster delivery times compared to others, benchmark best practices from these platforms and consider standardizing processes across all platforms.

**Data-Driven Process Improvements:**

Although the direct correlation between order value and delivery time might not be strong, use predictive analytics to uncover hidden patterns. This can help in designing strategies that optimize delivery logistics based on order characteristics.

**By integrating these recommendations into your operations, you can work toward reducing delays, lowering refund rates, and ultimately driving higher customer satisfaction and increased revenue.**
